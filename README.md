ansible-nixos-infect
====================

Install nixos from another [linux distribution in-place](https://nixos.org/nixos/manual/index.html#sec-installing-from-other-distro).

Just like [nixos-infect](https://github.com/elitak/nixos-infect/), but implemented as ansible playbook, which simplifies some steps and might be easier to adapt to different distributions/environments. And it's being executed via ssh nevertheless.

Just a proof of concept atm, i.e. not a replacement for *nixos-infect*.
